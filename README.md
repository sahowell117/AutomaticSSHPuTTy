# AutomaticSSHPuTTy

This is a litte script that can automatically open putty and ssh multiple times into whatever device you want from your pc. 
just type your username/passwd and ip of the device into the relevant spots, and you'll also need to take a screenshot of the 'open'
button that is visible on the putty configuration window and save that to the same dir as this script, otherwise it won't know where to
click.
